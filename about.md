title: About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and associate member at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.

<div class="about-content">
    <p>My main research interests lie at the intersection of social stratification and life course inequalities.</p>

    <p>I am the principal investigator of the SNSF grant on the determinants of saving and consumption behavior. My research focuses on analyzing these outcomes in Europe and the United States. In addition, I am designing a randomized experiment to examine whether financial literacy interventions can improve people's saving and investment decisions.</p>

    <p>Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Social Sciences from the University of Lausanne, where I studied the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. My research shed light on its far-reaching effects on various social dimensions, particularly income and health inequalities.</p>

    <p>I have worked with several large-scale cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys such as the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Social Survey (ESS), the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), and the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS).</p>
