I translate complex data into actionable insights that inform strategic decisions and address real-world challenges. My experience spans quantitative research, machine learning, and experimental design, honed at institutions such as the [University of Oxford](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/jad-moawad) and the European Commission. This background allows me to offer a precise blend of analytical rigor and practical solutions. 

Proficient in Python, R, SQL, advanced statistical modeling, data pipelines, and visualization platforms (Tableau, Power BI), I excel at leveraging diverse data sets to deliver meaningful insights. From designing experiments and building predictive algorithms to crafting compelling data narratives, I consistently contribute effective strategies aimed at operational excellence and sustainable growth.

Currently based in Toronto, Canada, I hold Permanent Residence status and am actively exploring opportunities to bring my expertise and passion for data-driven decision-making to new teams and challenges. Please feel free to review my portfolio, and letâ€™s discuss how I can add value to your organization.
